Question: Explain the event bubbling and capturing in JavaScript.
Answer: Event bubbling is a process where an event triggered on a nested element "bubbles up" through its ancestors, triggering their event handlers too. Event capturing is the opposite, where the event is captured at the topmost element and then propagates down to the target element.
